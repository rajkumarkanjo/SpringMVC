# SpringMVC
Spring MVC , RESTful , Complete CRUD operation.
I have used postgres DB to save the user record. 
The user table name is = userjsp
We can create a user and can assign the role : User , Admin
if the user_role is 'admin' he can login from admin login page , and can perform all the operations.
