# SpringMVC
Spring MVC , RESTful , Complete CRUD operation.
I have used postgres DB to save the user record. (it has migrated to H2 Database(in-memory) - http://localhost:8080/h2-console) )
The user table name is = userjsp
We can create a user and can assign the role : User , Admin
if the user_role is 'admin' he can login from admin login page , and can perform all the CRUD operations.

# Run the application
Download or clone the source code
You can also import the projects into your favorite IDE and start the application.
Start the Spring Boot Application -> Run As -> Java Application.

....................
Now open the Link :-  http://localhost:8080/login
                      http://localhost:8080/adminlogin (Once You have created an user as user-role : Admin can login from here)
